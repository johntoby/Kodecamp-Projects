DEVOPS TASK 2  - SUBMITTED BY JOHN IDOWU


Task 1 = Create the following new users for the organization: 

$ sudo -i (to switch to root user)

# useradd Andrew
# useradd Julius
# useradd Chizi
# useradd Jennifer
# useradd Adeola
# useradd Bach
# useradd Gozie
# useradd Ogochukwu

# cat /etc/passwd (to confirm if users have been successfully created) 


Task 2 - Create Groups 

# groupadd HR
# groupadd Sales
# groupadd Business
# groupadd Management
# groupadd IT
# groupadd Finance
#groupadd Legal 

# getent group (to confirm groups have been created) 

Task 3 - Add users to groups 

# usermod -aG IT Andrew
# usermod -aG IT Gozie
# usermod -aG HR Chizi
# usermod -aG Sales Jennifer
# usermod -aG Business Adeola
# usermod -aG Management Bach
# usermod -aG Finance Ogochukwu
# usermod -aG Legal Julius

#getent group ( to confirm if users have been added to the groups successfully) 



Task 4 - Create company directories for storing files, documents and information 

# mkdir Finance_Budgets Contract_Documents Business_Projections Business_Models Employee_Data Company_Vision_And_Mission_Statement Server_Configuration_Script




Task 5 - Assign the right Group  Access to the directories 

This is the breakdown of how I will assign the directories to the company groups: 
Finance Budgets - Finance, Management
Contract Documents - Legal, Management 
Business Projections - Sales, Business, Management 
Business Models - Sales, Business, Management 
Employee Data - HR, Management 
Company Vision and Mission Statement - HR, Management 
Server Configuration Script - IT, Management 

I am using setfacl (set file access control list) to set the file permission to their respective groups 

# setfacl -m g:Management:rwx ./Finance_Budgets/
# setfacl -m g:Finance:rwx ./Finance_Budgets/
# setfacl -m g:Management:rwx ./Contract_Documents/
# setfacl -m g:Legal:rwx ./Contract_Documents/
# setfacl -m g:Sales:rwx ./Business_Projections/
# setfacl -m g:Business:rwx ./Business_Projections/
# setfacl -m g:Management:rwx ./Business_Projections/
# setfacl -m g:Management:rwx ./Business_Models/
# setfacl -m g:Sales:rwx ./Business_Models/
# setfacl -m g:Business:rwx ./Business_Models/
# setfacl -m g:HR:rwx ./Employee_Data/
# setfacl -m g:Management:rwx ./Employee_Data/
# setfacl -m g:Management:rwx ./Company_Vision_And_Mission_Statement/
# setfacl -m g:HR:rwx ./Company_Vision_And_Mission_Statement/
# setfacl -m g:IT:rwx ./Server_Configuration_Script/
# setfacl -m g:Management:rwx ./Server_Configuration_Script/

To confirm if the right group has been added to the directories, I used: 
#getfacl Finance_Budgets/


Task 6 - Set the right permissions on each directory. User can rwx, Group can rwx, Others cannot rwx 


# chmod 777 Finance_Budgets/
# chmod 770 Finance_Budgets/
# chmod 770 Contract_Documents/
#  chmod 770 Business_Projections/
# chmod 770 Business_Models/
# chmod 770 Employee_Data/
# chmod 770 Company_Vision_And_Mission_Statement/
# chmod 770 Server_Configuration_Script/


To confirm if the right permissions settings have been applied, use: 
# ls -l 




The end.
